# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
In this analysis, we aimed to create a platform for consumers to serach worldwide locations and retrieve informoation about the weather in those areas in order to inform their decision for vacation areas through the utilization of APIs.

## Results
- Compiling Weather Data

Our first goal in this project was to compile the appropriate data together in order to create a dataframe that contains the cities, countries, and thier respective weather conditions. By accomplishing this, we were then able to use this information to fulfill our other goals.

- User Input

Another goal in this project was to ensure that our platform could take in user inputs for weather criteria in order to narrow their search. When prompted, the user is to put in their maximum and minimum temperature preference so that our system can return cities around the world fall within the desired range.

- Generateing Vacation Map

Additionally, in order to make the information more visually understandable to the user, our output includes a map with markers indicationg the cities worldwide that fall into the users preferences. Upon clicking on the markers, information about the city's weather is displayed aswell.

- Creating Travel Plan

Lastly, we enabled the program to provide a psudo travel plan for the user to help then plan out a trip that spans multiple cities. Here we displayed an informative map that would map out the route for which the user can travel between the cities and also the markers for each city so that they can see the weather conditions.
